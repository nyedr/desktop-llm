The exact time of birth is not specified.\n\n**System Interaction**\n----------------------\n\nThe user's birthday is used as a point of interaction with the system, as indicated by the **Birthday** event in the relationships table. The **timestamp** field also contains the user's birthday as a point of interaction.\n\n**Unique Identifiers**\n----------------------\n\nThe user's birthday is identified by the **E_17** unique identifier, which is a numerical value representing the user's birthday.\n\n**Role and Organization**\n-------------------------\n\nThe organization responsible for the metadata system is the **ERC** (Organization), which oversees the user's interaction with the system.

      "return": "Based on the provided data, it appears that the user's birthday is inferred to be November 17. This information is extracted from the content metadata, where the user types \"November 17 is my birthday!\".\n\n\nThis inference is supported by the relationships table, which shows that the user's birthday is linked to the \"MY BIRTHDAY\" entity, and the \"MY BIRTHDAY\" entity is further linked to the \"USER\" entity, indicating that the user is Jessica. The entity \"MY BIRTHDAY\" is also linked to the \"PAGE\" entity, suggesting that the birthday information is likely to be found on a page of personal details.\n\n\nAdditionally, the content metadata (Source) provides a specific timestamp for the user's message, which is \"2024-12-30T18:29:22.189016\". However, this timestamp appears to be related to a different message, as the user had previously asked \"When is my birthday?\".\n\n\nIt's worth noting that the entity \"MY BIRTHDAY\" is also linked to the \"E_17\" entity, which seems to be a unique identifier for the user. This suggests that the birthday information may be related to the user's identification or profile.",
